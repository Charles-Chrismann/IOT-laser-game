# IOT-laser-game

This project was carried out as part of a week of Internet Of Things. It tries to mimic the laser game.

The principle is as follows, a gun equipped with an infrared transmitter-receiver emits light to a receiver, another infrared transmitter-receiver, the latter detects it, thus transmitting the information to its raspberry pico card, which sends the information to the API on the network. The gun retrieves this information and displays it on the screen.
